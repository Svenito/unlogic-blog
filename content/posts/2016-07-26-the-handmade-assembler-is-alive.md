So last time I posted about this, it didn't make it into the release version of radare2, but since then, I've completed the core instructions for it, and it's made its way into the master branch of radare2.

This refactor means that tab is now retired to radare2-extras, and still available via `r2pm`. Future plans are to also push olly in that direction and make nz the only compiler that comes with the radare2 source.

There's still plenty to do on nz, so if you want to help out, hop on the IRC channel \#radare on freenode and have a chat with the friendly dev team. I really enjoyed working on this, and the folks on the project are very helpful.

But now the crunch is over I am going to use some of the spare time to work on some other things, so hopefully the post count here will pick back up soon :)
