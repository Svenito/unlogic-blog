This domain has been sitting empty for a while. I used to write a fair amount, but
eventually time to write became scarcer and the subject matter to write on dried up.
I ended up not enjoying the process any more and maintaining a blog does take
more effort than I initially thought. More so when you can't think of anything interesting
to write about anymore. So with it sitting stagnant, devoid of updates or new content,
I decided to just take down the whole lot. I'm aware that it isn't the nicest thing
to do, as people might perhaps want to refer to some old post I wrote, but in the end
it's my blog and my choice.

I don't really know how many people come here, but even if I don't get any readers,
it might be a good outlet for some brain dumps and a possible motivator for some
new projects. Time will bear witness to how much attention I give these pages.
